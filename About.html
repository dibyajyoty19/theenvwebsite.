<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>Sustainable development calls for a long-term structural strategy for the world's economic and social systems, which aims to reduce the burden on the environment and on natural resources to a permanently viable level, while still maintaining economic growth and social cohesion. Only development that manages to balance these three dimensions can be sustained in the long term. Conversely, ignoring one of the three aspects could potentially endanger the success of the entire development process.



</p>
<h2><u>Social solidarity</u></h2>
<p>Equality of opportunities for people, involving welfare, quality of life and sustainable human development –development should liberate individual capacities and fulfil human needs, thus ending poverty and improving individuals' quality of life offering a secure life with full rights and liberties in the long term - and social cohesion
</p>
<h2><U>Environmental Responsiblity</u></h2>
<p>The ability to use natural resources without undermining the equilibrium and integrity of ecosystems, reduce burden on the environment.In general, countries with the greatest single rate of depletion of the world's natural resources (eg, the highest levels of resource use, waste production and greenhouse gas emissions) are also the countries with the largest proportion of their urban population.
    Moreover, the greatest use of resources and waste production in the world is concentrated within urban areas.
    
    Urban policies have very important implications for future levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the use of most resources in the State, given their role in the design and construction of buildings in urban areas and in the spatial shape of cities and urban systems.
    
</p>

<h2><u>Economic Dimensions</u></h2>
<p>
    Sustainable development requires the rationalization of economic approaches, foremost of which is the idea of ​​"environmental accounting of natural resources".

    The value of the elements of the environment stored in oil and gas fields, coal deposits, mining, and others have not been included in the calculation of cost.
    
    To include the value of fish money in the value of the fish stock, the crop of agricultural areas in the value of the lack of fertility of the land, and in many cases does not count the cost of irrigation water in agricultural accounting works.
